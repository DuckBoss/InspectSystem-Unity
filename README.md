# NOTICE:
<b>I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON AN UPDATED VERSION FOR UNITY v2018. IT WILL BE A LOT MORE STREAMLINED AND EASIER TO INTEGRATE INTO ANY PROJECT.</b>

# InspectSystem-Unity
An inspection/examination system to read in-game signs, walls, etc.  
Tested on Unity 2017/2018.

## Dependencies
1) <b>Text Mesh Pro</b> (Available for Free on the Unity Asset Store, used for the in-game UI, can be replaced with default Unity UI elements by messing with the code very easily)  
<i> Note:  Text Mesh Pro is now a built-in package with Unity 2018+ </i>

2) <b>Unity Standard Assets</b> (For the demo project, this isn't required for implementing into your own games)

## Demo Scene
- Press 'E' while looking at the sign and standing next to it.

## Features
- Supports markup language in text dialogues
- Supports pitch modulated sfx for text dialogues
- Configuration for reinspectable or non-reinspectable objects. (can/cannot inspect items more than once)
- Implemented unityevents that can be executed at the end of inspection dialogues
- Tooltips to help explain inspector variables
